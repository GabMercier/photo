I'm a photographer passionate about capturing the beauty in everyday moments. My work explores the intersection of light, texture, and emotion.

With a background in fine arts and a love for the natural world, I seek to create images that invite viewers to pause and look closer. Whether it's the first frost of winter or the golden hour of a summer evening, I find inspiration in the changing seasons and the subtle details that often go unnoticed.

## My Approach

Every photograph tells a story. I believe in patient observation—waiting for the perfect moment when light and subject align. My process is contemplative, often spending hours in a single location to truly understand the scene before me.

## Equipment

- Sony A7R IV
- Various prime and macro lenses
- Natural light whenever possible
